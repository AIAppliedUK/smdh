# SMDH Architecture Comparison: All Four Options (A, B, C, D)

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive comparison of **four architectural approaches** for the Smart Manufacturing Data Hub (SMDH):

- **Option A**: AWS-Heavy Architecture (Flink-based stream processing)
- **Option B**: Snowflake-Leveraged Architecture (SQL-first unified platform)
- **Option C**: AWS IoT SiteWise Architecture (Managed IoT platform) - **CORRECTED COSTS** ✅

#### Option A (AWS-Heavy)

**Portability**:
- ✅ Flink is open-source (can run elsewhere)
- ✅ Can migrate to GCP/Azure equivalents
- ✅ Standard SQL in Snowflake
- ❌ AWS IoT Core is proprietary
- ❌ Kinesis is AWS-specific
- ❌ Lambda is AWS-specific

**Exit Strategy**:
- Move Flink to another cloud or on-prem
- Replace Kinesis with Kafka
- Replace Lambda with containerized services
- Keep Snowflake or migrate to another DW

**Lock-in Level**: **Medium** (distributed across services)

#### Option B (Snowflake-Leveraged)

**Portability**:
- ✅ Standard SQL (mostly)
- ✅ Python UDFs portable
- ❌ Snowflake Streams/Tasks are proprietary
- ❌ Dynamic Tables are Snowflake-specific
- ❌ Cortex ML is Snowflake-only
- ❌ Snowpipe Streaming is proprietary

**Exit Strategy**:
- Export data to S3/GCS/Azure Blob
- Rewrite Tasks as Airflow DAGs
- Rewrite Dynamic Tables as dbt models
- Migrate Cortex ML to SageMaker/Vertex AI

**Lock-in Level**: **High** (Snowflake-centric)

**Verdict**: **Option A** more portable, but **both have significant lock-in**

## Migration Path Considerations

### Starting with Option B, Evolving to Hybrid

**Recommended Approach**:

1. **Phase 1**: Implement Option B (Snowflake-centric)
   - Faster time to market (20 weeks vs 24)
   - Prove out use cases
   - Validate latency requirements
   - 15-20% lower costs

2. **Phase 2**: Monitor and Identify Gaps
   - Track real-time latency SLAs
   - Identify ML limitations
   - Assess operational load

3. **Phase 3**: Add Option A Components Selectively
   - Add Flink only if real-time is critical
   - Add SageMaker only for custom ML
   - Keep majority of processing in Snowflake

**Hybrid Architecture Benefits**:
- Best of both worlds
- Start simple, add complexity as needed
- Incremental investment

### Starting with Option A

**If you start with Option A**:
- ✅ Ready for any real-time requirement
- ✅ Maximum flexibility from day 1
- ❌ Longer time to market

### Final Recommendation **UPDATED** ✅

**Primary Recommendation: Start with Option B (Snowflake)**, validate assumptions during Phases 1-2, and make a go/no-go decision on adding Option A components at Week 14 based on actual performance data.

**Decision Framework:**

```
Is AWS-native a hard requirement (no Snowflake allowed)?
├─ YES → Choose Option D (Timestream + Grafana) - Best AWS-native
└─ NO → Is cost/simplicity top priority?
    ├─ YES → Choose Option B (Snowflake) ← **RECOMMENDED**
    └─ NO → Do you have deep SiteWise expertise?
        ├─ YES → Consider Option C (SiteWise) for <10 tenants
        └─ NO → Is sub-second latency legally required?
            ├─ YES → Choose Option A (Flink)
            └─ NO → Choose Option B (Snowflake)
```

**Key Points:**
- ✅ **Option B remains the best choice** for most scenarios
- ✅ **Option D is viable** if Snowflake is blocked (AWS-native mandate)
- ✅ **Option C is NOW viable** (corrected costs) but has multi-tenancy concerns
- ⚠️ **Option A only if** sub-second latency is a legal/regulatory requirement

This de-risks the project while maintaining the ability to add complexity only where necessary.

## Document Control

- **Version**: 1.1 **CORRECTED**
- **Date**: October 24, 2025 (Revised with corrected Option C costs)
- **Author**: Architecture Team
- **Status**: Comparison Analysis - **4 Options Compared**
- **Review Date**: January 2025
- **Distribution**: Project Stakeholders and Decision Makers
- **Major Changes in v1.1**:
  - ✅ Corrected Option C (SiteWise) cost calculations (from $21,150 to $6,334/month)
  - ✅ Added Option D (Timestream + Grafana) to comparison
  - ✅ Updated recommendation hierarchy and decision framework
  - ✅ Clarified storage calculation methodology across all options

---

*This comparison document should be used alongside the detailed architecture documents for all four options to make an informed decision on the optimal approach for the Smart Manufacturing Data Hub.*

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Option C (SiteWise) costs were initially calculated incorrectly due to data volume misinterpretation. The corrected analysis shows Option C is **viable** (not cost-prohibitive) but remains 3rd choice due to multi-tenancy and timeline considerations.
