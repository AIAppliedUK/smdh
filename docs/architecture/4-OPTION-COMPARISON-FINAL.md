### 2. Cost Breakdown Detail

#### Monthly Infrastructure Costs

| Component | A | B | C **CORRECTED** | D |
|-----------|---|---|-----------------|---|
| **Primary Data Storage** |
| Snowflake credits | $1,200-1,800 | $1,600-2,500 | $0 | $0 |
| SiteWise | $0 | $0 | **$1,868** ✅ | $0 |
| Timestream | $0 | $0 | $3,795 (job tracking) | $947 (all data) |
| **AWS Infrastructure** |
| IoT Core | $150 | $150 | **$237** ✅ | $237 |
| Kinesis | $200 | $100 | $0 | $109 |
| Lambda | $200 | $50 | $22 | $8 |
| EMR (Flink) | $300 | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| DynamoDB | $50 | $50 | $16 | $19 |
| CloudWatch | $100 | $50 | $300 | $378 |
| API Gateway | $100 | $50 | $18 | $18 |
| Grafana Cloud | $0 | $0 | $0 | $290 |
| Other | $200 | $220 | $78 | $959 |
| **TOTAL** | **$2,500-4,200** | **$2,170-3,450** | **$6,334** ✅ | **$3,965** |

#### Why Option C Costs More

**Option C is most expensive due to**:
1. **Dual storage required**: SiteWise ($1,868) + Timestream ($3,795) = $5,663/month
   - SiteWise for time-series (machine, energy, air quality)
   - Timestream needed for job tracking events (SiteWise poor fit for discrete events)
2. **Higher CloudWatch costs**: $300/month (1,500 SiteWise alarms)
3. **Slightly higher IoT Core**: $237 vs $150 (more granular device management)

**Despite higher cost, Option C is VIABLE** ($211/tenant within $200-300 budget)

### 3. Multi-Tenancy Approach

| Option | Method | Security Level | Ease of Implementation | Maintenance |
|--------|--------|----------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **A** | Snowflake RLS | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Good | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Low |
| **B** | Snowflake RLS | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Low |
| **C** | SiteWise Tags + App Layer | ⭐⭐⭐ Moderate | ⭐⭐ Difficult | ⭐⭐ High |
| **D** | Timestream Partitions | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Good | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Good | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Low |

**Key Concerns with Option C**:
- ⚠️ **No native Row-Level Security**: Must filter by tags in every API query
- ⚠️ **Application-layer risk**: Developer error could expose tenant data
- ⚠️ **Higher audit complexity**: Requires custom logging for data access
- ⚠️ **Not SaaS-native**: SiteWise designed for single-enterprise, not multi-tenant SaaS

**Winner**: **Options B & D** (native, secure, minimal code)

---

### 4. Dashboard & Visualization

| Option | Solution | White-Labeling | Multi-Tenancy | Embeddable | Cost |
|--------|----------|----------------|---------------|------------|------|
| **A** | QuickSight | ⚠️ Limited | ⚠️ Manual | ✅ Yes ($0.30/session) | $18/user/month |
| **B** | QuickSight | ⚠️ Limited | ⚠️ Manual | ✅ Yes ($0.30/session) | $18/user/month |
| **C** | Custom React | ✅ Full | ✅ Custom | ✅ Yes | Dev time (included) |
| **D** | Grafana Cloud | ✅ **Full** | ✅ **Native Orgs** | ✅ **Yes (free)** | **$290/month** |

**Why Grafana (Option D) Wins**:
- ✅ **Industry-standard** for time-series visualization
- ✅ **Multi-tenant organizations** (tenant isolation built-in)
- ✅ **White-labeling** (custom logo, colors, domain)
- ✅ **100+ data sources** (not locked to one platform)
- ✅ **Free embedding** (no per-session charges)
- ✅ **Advanced alerting** (better than CloudWatch alone)

**Option C Dashboard Challenge**:
- SiteWise Monitor **cannot be white-labeled** for SaaS
- Must build **custom React dashboards** from scratch
- Development time: **4-6 weeks** additional effort
- Maintenance burden for updates/features

### 5. Implementation Timeline

| Phase | A | B | C | D | Notes |
|-------|---|---|---|---|-------|
| Foundation | 3 weeks | 3 weeks | 3 weeks | 3 weeks | Similar (VPC, Cognito, IoT) |
| Data Ingestion | 3 weeks | 2 weeks | 4 weeks | 3 weeks | C: SiteWise asset models |
| Use Cases | 4 weeks | 3 weeks | 5 weeks | 3 weeks | C: Custom dashboards |

| Testing & Hardening | 3 weeks | 2 weeks | 5 weeks | 3 weeks | C: Multi-tenant security testing |
| Buffer | 4 weeks | 4 weeks | 4 weeks | 4 weeks | Risk contingency |
| **TOTAL** | **24 weeks** | **20 weeks** ✅ | **28 weeks** | **22 weeks** | |

**Time to Market**:
- 🥇 **Option B**: 20 weeks (fastest)
- 🥈 **Option D**: 22 weeks (+2 weeks)
- 🥉 **Option A**: 24 weeks (+4 weeks)
- **Option C**: 28 weeks (+8 weeks, slowest due to custom dashboard dev)

## Key Findings Summary

### 1. All Options Are Viable ✅

**Budget Compliance**: All 4 options meet $200-300/tenant target
- Option B: $72-115/tenant ✅ (cheapest)
- Option A: $83-140/tenant ✅
- Option D: $132/tenant ✅
- Option C: $211/tenant ✅ (was incorrectly stated as $705)

### 2. Option C Was Incorrectly Dismissed

**Error Found**: Data volume calculation inflated by **7.3x**
- **Incorrect**: "2.6B values/day" (miscalculated)
- **Correct**: "117M values/month" (from requirements)
- **Impact**: Cost reduced from $21,150 to $6,334/month (70% reduction)
- **Status**: Option C is now **viable** (3rd choice)

### 3. Multi-Tenancy is Critical Differentiator

**Ranking**:
1. **Options B & A**: Snowflake Row-Level Security (native, secure)
2. **Option D**: Timestream partition keys (native, good)
3. **Option C**: SiteWise tags + app-layer filtering (manual, risky)

**Why Option C ranks lower**: No native multi-tenant RLS creates security risk for SaaS

### 4. Alert Latency is Solvable

**Requirement**: <10 seconds for alerts (FR-11)
- **Options A, C, D**: ✅ Meet natively
- **Option B**: ❌ 60-65 seconds → **Fixable** with Lambda fast-path (+$100-150/month, +2 weeks)

**Recommended**: Option B + Lambda alert fast-path = Best overall

### 5. Timeline Varies Significantly

- **Fastest**: Option B (20 weeks)
- **Slowest**: Option C (28 weeks) - custom dashboard development
- **Difference**: 2 months time-to-market impact

---

## Final Recommendation

### Primary: Option B (Snowflake) + Lambda Fast-Path

**Architecture**:
- Snowflake for all data storage and analytics (as designed)
- Lambda fast-path for <10-second alerts (add-on)
- QuickSight or PowerBI for dashboards
- Total cost: $2,270-3,600/month (+$100-150 for Lambda)

**Why This Wins**:
- ✅ **Meets all requirements** including alert SLA
- ✅ **Lowest cost** ($72-115/tenant)
- ✅ **Simplest** (5 core services + Lambda)
- ✅ **Fastest** (20 weeks + 2 weeks for Lambda)
- ✅ **Lowest risk** (proven technology stack)
- ✅ **Best governance** (unified platform)

### Alternative 1: Option D (Timestream + Grafana)

**If Snowflake is blocked** (organizational policy, procurement):
- **Cost**: $3,965/month ($132/tenant) - 15% more than Option B
- **Benefit**: Fully AWS-native, industry-best dashboards (Grafana)
- **Timeline**: 22 weeks (2 weeks slower than B)

### Alternative 2: Option C (SiteWise)

**Only if**:
- Team has deep SiteWise expertise
- Single-tenant or <10 tenants (multi-tenancy less critical)
- Willing to build custom React dashboards
- Accept highest cost ($211/tenant)
- Accept longest timeline (28 weeks)

**Not recommended for**: Multi-tenant SaaS at scale (30-100 tenants)

### Alternative 3: Option A (Flink)

**Only if**:
- Sub-second latency is regulatory requirement
- Team has Flink expertise
- Budget supports highest TCO
- Can accept highest complexity

## Appendix: Cost Correction Details

### Option C Original vs Corrected

| Component | Original (Incorrect) | Corrected | Correction |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------|------------|
| SiteWise Ingestion | ~~$10,700~~ | **$59** | **-99.4%** ✅ |
| SiteWise Storage | ~~$87~~ | **$1** | **-98.9%** ✅ |
| SiteWise Compute | ~~$1,175~~ | **$38** | **-96.8%** ✅ |
| SiteWise Subtotal | ~~$13,732~~ | **$1,868** | **-86.4%** ✅ |
| IoT Core | ~~$2,400~~ | **$237** | **-90.1%** ✅ |
| **TOTAL MONTHLY** | ~~$21,150~~ | **$6,334** | **-70.0%** ✅ |
| **Cost per Tenant** | ~~$705~~ | **$211** | **-70.1%** ✅ |

### Root Cause of Error

**Incorrect Calculation**:
```
❌ "1,000 machines × 30 properties × 86,400 samples = 2.6B values/day"
❌ This multiplied properties × samples instead of using total rows
```

**Correct Calculation**:
```
✅ Requirements: "2.6M-3.9M rows/day TOTAL" (all devices, all properties)
✅ Monthly: 3.9M/day × 30 days = 117M values/month
✅ SiteWise cost: 117M ÷ 1000 × $0.50 = $58.50/month
```

**Lesson Learned**: Always trace calculations back to source requirements
